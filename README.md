## The Idea

The main project is to make the a Page that you can log In and make changes as a Staff Or an Admin.

Basically the whole project is going to have 

- User Authentication (Admin vs. Staff)
- Database Integration (Instead of just an ArrayList)
- Stock Threshold Alerts (Warn when stock is low)
- Sales Management (Track purchases and update stock)
- Reports & Analytics (Show sales trends)

2. Product Management
	- Each product has
	    - ID, Name, Quantity, Price, Supplier Info, Expiry Date
	- Admins can adddeletemodify products.
	- Staff can only update quantity when a sale is made.
3. Sales Processing
	- Each time a product is sold, it reduces stock.
	- If stock falls below a threshold, an alert is triggered.
4. Stock Threshold Alerts
	- If a productâ€™s quantity goes below a certain level, send an alert.
	- Example Warning! Low stock for item Laptop (Only 2 left).
